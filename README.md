# Mirror_roomManager_0.1
 copy and edit of vis2k/Mirror repository

open "New Unity Project" to see my work

This is my implementation of local multiplayer option, since I really need this option for my game

now you can set max. number of local players (theoretically unlimited)

this demo have default value for 4 player, demo may be bugged , but you should get the bacis from it

you can move them with keys:

W,A,S,D
arrows
numpad:8,5,6,4
I,K,J,L
